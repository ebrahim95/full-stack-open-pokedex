For the Golang I would choose the GoCD Tools. It also integrates with Dockers and Kubernates. 
Golang has it's own testing functions built in the language. golangci-lint is a tool that helps
linting the Golang. If the company is not strapped on cash then I would rather use the Cloud as it is more
reliable and easy to setup. On the other hand, if the team is strapped on cash and the software needs to be secure, I
rather do self-hosted.
